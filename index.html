    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
          <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>
              My education before epicodus seems archaic. I would have enjoyed chemistry much more with pairing. I attended some college with an attempt at a creative writing degree.
            </p>
          <h4>Job Experience</h4>
            <p>
              My job experience is mainly in culinary, some highlights include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Facebook(they have lots of cafes)</li>
                  <li>2Brothers Moving and Delivery(This was fun for a while, but i was the only "cultural brother" and customers made that joke alot.)</li>
